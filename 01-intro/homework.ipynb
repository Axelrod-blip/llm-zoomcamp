      "  text: \"The meaning of life is a philosophical question that has been pondered by humans for centuries. There is no one definitive answer, as the meaning of life is subjective and can vary from person to person. However, some common themes that have been proposed include:\\n\\n* To live a meaningful life, it is important to have purpose and direction. This could involve pursuing a career, raising a family, or making a difference in the world.\\n* It is also important to have strong relationships with others. Humans are social creatures, and we need strong bonds with family, friends, and loved ones in order to thrive.\\n* Finally, it is important to live in the present moment. The past is gone, and the future is uncertain. By focusing on the present, we can appreciate the beauty of life and make the most of our time.\\n\\nUltimately, the meaning of life is something that each individual must discover for themselves. There is no wrong or right answer. The important thing is to live a life that is fulfilling and meaningful to you.\"\n",
